# Spire Data Demos for Journalists

Welcome! This repo is part of a live data show-and-tell for journalists. 

It highlights a few compelling use cases for satellite-derived data from Spire Global — including weather, aviation, and agricultural insights.

## 🌍 Overview

These examples showcase how satellite data can be used in real-world journalism and analysis — from detecting GPS jamming in aviation, to predicting the emergence of billions of cicadas based on soil moisture data.

We’ve included links to:
- 🛰️ Live and interactive visual demos
- 📊 Raw data (CSV / GRIB2)
- 🧪 Notebooks and blog posts for deeper exploration

## ✈️ Aviation Data: GPS Jamming Detection

Spire uses satellite-captured ADS-B signals to monitor anomalies in aircraft position reporting — helping detect GPS spoofing or jamming activity around the world.

**🔗 Interactive Demo**  
[GPS Jamming Map (CodePen)](https://codepen.io/andjames/pen/YzoEPyP?editors=0011)  
> Uses real-world spoofing and jamming signal data from ADS-B broadcasts.  
_Data is embedded in the CodePen (CSV format)._

## 🌾 Soil Moisture & Cicada Forecasting

Spire’s weather models (powered by satellite GNSS radio occultation) provide detailed soil data — useful for everything from agriculture to unusual forecasts like insect emergence.

**🧬 Included GRIB2 Data**
- Soil moisture (low resolution)
- Soil temperature
- Latent and sensible heat
- 2m specific humidity
- Volumetric soil moisture

> These are from a weather model run over Europe. A sample agricultural GRIB2 file is included in this repo.

## 📦 Aviation Cargo Index (In Development)

Spire is developing a dashboard to highlight aviation cargo trends and insights, derived from satellite ADS-B and other datasets.

**🚧 Demo Dashboard (Beta)**  
[Aviation Cargo Index Dashboard](https://spiredata.wpenginepowered.com/#/dash)  
> Currently in development; feedback welcome!

This dashboard will soon include additional weather and climate data. If you’re interested in early access or want to stay in the loop, let us know.

## 📂 Files in This Repo

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `soil_data/` | GRIB2 files for weather and soil conditions in Europe |
| `gps_jamming.csv` | (Optional) Raw CSV used in CodePen if pulled out separately |
| `notebooks/` | Any demo Python notebooks (TBD) |
| `README.md` | You're here! |

## 🛠️ Ideas for Exploration

- Use Python to parse GRIB2 weather files with `cfgrib` or `xarray`
- Map GPS jamming activity geographically using `folium` or `plotly`
- Compare soil temperature and moisture across time for storytelling potential
