# Spire* Data Demos for Journalists

Welcome! This repo is part of a live data show-and-tell for journalists. 

It highlights a few compelling use cases for satellite-derived data from Spire Global, including weather, aviation, and agricultural insights.

## 🔥 Fire Camera Map (Experimental)
<img src="https://andjam.es/cafires/VIIRS+california-fire-cameras.png" alt="Wildfire Camera + Satellite Detection Map" width="600" />

This experimental map combines near real-time satellite fire detections with more than 1,000 wildfire cameras across the western U.S. Each camera shows a directional view cone that dynamically rotates and intensifies as nearby fire activity increases.

**🛰️ Live Demo**  
[Fire Camera Map](https://andjam.es/cafires)  
> Includes satellite hotspots (VIIRS/MODIS), AI object detections (early-stage), and camera directionality.

This prototype explores how public data can be layered to improve situational awareness in wildfire events. While many of the AI detections are false alarms (surfboards, giraffes…), the potential is clear. Feedback and collaboration welcome!

## 🌍 Overview

These examples showcase how satellite data can be used in real-world journalism and analysis, from detecting GPS jamming in aviation, to predicting the emergence of billions of cicadas based on soil moisture data.

We’ve included links to:
- 🛰️ Live and interactive visual demos
- 📊 Raw data (CSV / GRIB2)
- 🧪 Notebooks and blog posts for deeper exploration

## ✈️ Aviation Data: GPS Jamming Detection
<img src="assets/baltic-gps-jamming.png" alt="GPS jamming map" width="400" />
Spire uses satellite-captured ADS-B signals to monitor anomalies in aircraft position reporting, helping detect GPS spoofing or jamming activity around the world.

**🔗 Interactive Demo**  
[GPS Jamming Map (CodePen)](https://codepen.io/andjames/pen/YzoEPyP?editors=0011)  
> Uses real-world spoofing and jamming signal data from ADS-B broadcasts.  
_Data is embedded in the CodePen (CSV format)._

## 💨 Wind, Renewables & Climate Change
<img src="assets/wind-generation.png" alt="Wind Generation Chart" width="600" />
Spire’s weather and climate data helps analysts and energy producers better understand wind patterns and variability — both today and decades into the future. This is critical for planning renewable power generation and adapting to long-term climate shifts.

**📝 Related Blog Post**  
[Wind & Climate Change: Forecasting for the Future](https://insights.spire.com/wind-climate-change-for-the-future)

> Covers long-term trends in wind speed and power density, with implications for renewable energy strategy and resilience.

## 🌾 Soil Moisture & Cicada Forecasting
<img src="assets/cicada-broods-and-SMI.png" alt="Soil Moisture" width="500" />
Spire’s weather models (powered by satellite GNSS radio occultation) provide detailed soil data, useful for everything from agriculture to unusual forecasts like insect emergence.

**🧬 Included GRIB2 Data**
- Soil moisture (low resolution)
- Soil temperature
- Latent and sensible heat
- 2m specific humidity
- Volumetric soil moisture

> These are from a weather model run over Europe. A sample agricultural GRIB2 file is included in this repo.

## 📦 Aviation Cargo Index (In Development)
<img src="assets/aviation-data-cargo-index.png" alt="Aviation: Cargo Index" width="600" />
Spire is developing a dashboard to highlight aviation cargo trends and insights, derived from satellite ADS-B and other datasets.

**🚧 Demo Dashboard (Beta)**

## 🛠️ Ideas for Exploration

- Use Python to parse GRIB2 weather files with `cfgrib` or `xarray`
- Map GPS jamming activity geographically (lots going on around the Baltic Sea).
- Inspect soil moisture values in the Khumbu Region of Nepal during Everest Climbing season
- Soil Moisture and the effectiveness of carbon capture/sequestration programs
- Tariffs and cargo flight variations
- Compare soil temperature and moisture across time for storytelling potential
